# icq.bot.net

C# wrapper for ICQ Bot APIs. Inspired by [Telegram.Bot](https://github.com/TelegramBots/Telegram.Bot)

No Microsoft proprietary mambo jumbo needed! Built on .Net Core 3.1 and Newtonsoft Json package.

With this package you can:
* Get Bot Events - polling is currently the only way to get events from ICQ :(
* Send Text Message
* Edit Text Message
* Send File (supports image and video)

Let's make .Net the #1 client in ICQ New platform!

NuGet package avaiable at [nuget.org](https://www.nuget.org/packages/ICQ.Bot/1.0.0)
