# icq.bot.net

C# wrapper for ICQ Bot APIs. Inspired by [Telegram.Bot](https://github.com/TelegramBots/Telegram.Bot)

No Microsoft proprietary mumbo jumbo needed! Just the cool .Net Core 3.1 and Newtonsoft Json package and you're up and running.

Currently supports the following:
* Get Bot Updates - polling is currently the only supported method to run your ICQ bot :(
* Send Text Message
* Edit Text Message
* Send File (supports image and video)

Let's make .Net the #1 client in ICQ New platform!
