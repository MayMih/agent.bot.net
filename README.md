# icq.bot.net

C# wrapper for ICQ Bot APIs. Inspired by [Telegram.Bot]

No Microsoft proprietary mambo jumbo needed! Built on the goodness of .Net Core 3.1 and Json.Net

## What's in it for me?
With this package you can:
* Get Bot Events - polling is currently the only way to get events from ICQ :(
* Send Text Messages
* Edit Text Messages
* Send Files (supports image and video)

## How do I get it?
NuGet package is avaiable at [nuget.org]

## How do I ramp up?
Usage is similar to the excellent .Net [Telegram.Bot] project.

Let's make .Net the #1 client for ICQ bots!
