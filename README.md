# icq.bot.net

C# wrapper for ICQ Bot APIs. Inspired by https://github.com/TelegramBots/Telegram.Bot

No Microsoft proprietary mumbo jumbo needed - just the cool .Net core 3.1 and Newtonsoft Json package and you're up and running.

Currently supports the following:
* Get Bot Updates - polling is currently the only supported method to run your ICQ bot :(
* Send Text Message
* Edit Text Message
* Send File (supports image and video)

Let's make .Net the #1 client in ICQ New platform!
